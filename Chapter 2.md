# Chapter 2 Creating a dataset
## Understanding datasets
A dataset is usually a rectangular array of data with rows representing observations and columns representing variables

## Data structures
R has a wide variety of objects for holding data, including scalars, vectors, matrices, arrays, data frames, and lists.

`**Some definitions**`  
In R, an object is anything that can be assigned to a variable. This includes constants, data structures, functions, and even graphs. Objects have a mode (which describes how the object is stored) and a class (which tells generic functions like print how to handle it).  
A data frame is a structure in R that holds data and is similar to the datasets found in standard statistical packages. The columns are variables and the rows are observations.  
Factors are nominal or ordinal variables. Theyâ€™re stored and treated specially in R.
